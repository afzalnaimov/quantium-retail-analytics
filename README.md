## Overview

This project analyzes customer transaction data to uncover purchase behavior trends in the chips category and evaluates the impact of a promotional campaign in a trial store.


## Business Context  

As part of Quantiumâ€™s retail analytics division, the goal was to:  
- Segment chip shoppers based on affluence and life stage  
- Identify high-value customer groups  
- Measure the effectiveness of a marketing trial by comparing trial vs control stores  

## Key Tasks  
**Task 1: Customer Segmentation**  
- Cleaned and merged transaction and customer datasets  
- Segmented customers by affluence and life stage  
- Visualized purchase behavior across segments  

**Task 2: Campaign Effectiveness**  
- Paired a control store using historical performance  
- Compared KPIs (sales, frequency, customer count) pre- and post-trial  
- Confirmed positive campaign impact in Trial Store 77  

**Task 3: Strategic Presentation**  
- Created visuals and summaries for the category manager  
- Delivered commercial insights and recommendations  


## Tools & Skills Used  
- Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- Git & GitHub
- PowerPoint for final stakeholder presentation
- Data wrangling, visualization, and business storytelling


## Key Insights
- Mainstream and budget families drive most chips sales
- Promotional trial in Store 77 led to a clear increase in sales and customer count
- Control store analysis confirmed the uplift was due to the promotion, not seasonality
- Recommendations were made for a broader promotional rollout
